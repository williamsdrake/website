## <i class="fas fa-bacteria"></i> Host-microbe interactions in the oral mucosa
{% capture text %}
Relatively little is known how host cells respond to specific bacterial antigen and non-specific bacterial stimuli at the oral barrier.
We are generating the following tools in order to understand how antigen-specific responses to oral microbes contributes to disease pathogenesis:
- transgenic and retrogenic mice expressing a T cell receptor that recognizes *Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa)*
- MHC tetramers that identify *Aa*-specific T cells
These tools will enable:
- understanding of antigen-specific T cell responses in the oral mucosa
- targeted study of the role of oral microbes in peripheral disease
Additionally, we will utilitze the tool development pipeline to study the role of commensal microbes in oral mucosal homeostasis and disease.

## <i class="fas fa-laptop-medical"></i> Oral barrier composition in health and disease
{% capture text %}
We employ a systems biology approach to better understand homeostasis at the oral barrier, and importantly, how homeostasis is disrupted in inflammatory disease (periodontitis).
We are actively working to expand our understanding of processes that govern disease using a combination of next generation single cell and histology approaches.

## <i class="fas fa-syringe"></i> Mucosal immunity in mendelian disease
{% capture text %}
The Moutsopoulos Lab sees several cohorts of patients that have single gene mutations which lead to severe oral disease. Using single cell sequencing, we are assessing how experimental treatment influences cell composition and gene expression in:
- patients with a gain-of-function mutation in *Stat1*, which causes chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis and severe oral ulcers
- patients with leukocyte adhesion deficiency 1 (LAD1), which causes severe gingival immunopathology leading to early-life tooth loss
