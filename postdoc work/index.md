## <i class="fas fa-bacteria"></i> Host-microbe interactions in the oral mucosa
{% capture text %}
Relatively little is known how host cells respond to specific bacterial antigen and non-specific bacterial stimuli at the oral barrier.
To determine how the innate and adaptive immune system responds to bacterial and fungal stimuli, we are:  
- using flow-cytometry-based bacterial/fungal cell sorting and 16S/ITS sequencing to characterize taxa-specific coating of the oral microbiota with immunoglobulin 
- developing tools to assess T-cell specific responses to known oral pathogens

## <i class="fas fa-laptop-medical"></i> Oral barrier composition in health and disease
{% capture text %}
We employ a systems biology approach to better understand homeostasis at the oral barrier, and importantly, how homeostasis is disrupted in inflammatory disease (periodontitis).
We are actively working to expand our understanding of processes that govern disease using a combination of next generation single cell and histology approaches.

## <i class="fas fa-syringe"></i> Mucosal immunity in mendelian disease
{% capture text %}
The Moutsopoulos Lab sees several cohorts of patients that have single gene mutations which lead to severe oral disease. Using single cell sequencing, we are assessing how experimental treatment influences cell composition and gene expression in:
- patients with a gain-of-function mutation in *Stat1*, which causes chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis and severe oral ulcers
- patients with leukocyte adhesion deficiency 1 (LAD1), which causes severe gingival immunopathology leading to early-life tooth loss
