The relationship between the host and microbiota in barrier mucosal tissues is delicate and requires communication between microbes and host cells to initiate, adapt, and terminate responses in a manner that protects the host from infection and allows beneficial microbes to survive and thrive. I am interested in understanding what governs host-microbe communication in health and disease at the oral barrier.
