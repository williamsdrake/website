{% include section.html %}

My graduate studies culminated in several findings in understanding the pathogenesis of MRONJ including (1) I de-veloped and characterized a mouse model for MRONJ using a recently approved FDA treatment; (2) Using microar-
ray, I identified a pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-36??) that is critical in osteonecrosis development; (3) In a model of
ligature-induced periodontitis, I found that chronic inflammation exacerbates osteonecrosis development and re-
sults in local increases of CD3+IL23R+ cells; and (4) I discovered that the indigenous oral microbiota plays a role in
inflammation-induced osteonecrosis development.

## <i class="fas fa-bacteria"></i>Role of inflammation and microbiome in osteonecrosis development
It is unclear how confounding factors such as local inflammation and the indigenous microbiota influence the development of osteonecrosis.  
Here, we: 
- confirm that periodontal inflammation leads to increased osteonecrosis development in mice, but this effect is reversible if inflammation is removed prior to dental trauma
- found that chronic and apical periodontitis lead to a surge in Type 17 immune cells at the site of osteonecrosis, dependent on the duration of inflammation, and that the indigenous microbiota has a protective effect on the development of osteonecrosis in a mouse model of dysbiosis

These findings demonstrate the important role of dental health and oral microbiome in osteonecrosis development and have clinical outcome and quality-of-life implications for patients taking antiresorptive medication.

## <i class="fas fa-bacteria"></i>Mechanistic study of osteonecrosis development and etiology

The etiopathogenesis of an oral disease called medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) has been difficult to understand since its first report in 2003. In this project, We: 
- showed for the first time that bisphosphonates (BP) induce senescence in normal human oral keratinocytes but not fibroblasts, which instead undergo apoptosis at clinical levels of BP treatment
- observed novel histologic changes associated with the development of osteonecrotic lesions in a murine model that were reproducible with different antiresorptive drugs
- discovered the IL36 signaling pathway is partly responsible for osteonecrosis development after antiresorptive treatment and abrogation of this pathway prevents osteonecrosis formation following dental trauma
- found that IL36 may be released in extracellular vesicles by epithelial cells in response to mechanical damage and microbial signals  
This body of work has expanded our knowledge about the pathogenesis of MRONJ and has identified potential therapeutic targets.
